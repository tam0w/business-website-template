- Code always has to be responsive, think desktop first, mobile second when writing any feature.
- Always prefer modifying shadcn components rather than creating special inline styles, create variants if required, always stick and maintain a design system based on shadcn components, tailwind css variables.
- Static content lives in `/src/data/` as TypeScript constants. Dynamic content (posts, careers) comes from Convex.
- For Convex patterns and guidelines, see `.docs/convex-guidelines.md`.
