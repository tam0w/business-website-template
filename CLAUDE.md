- Code always has to be responsive, think desktop first, mobile second when writing any feature.
- Always prefer modifying shadcn components rather than creating special inline styles, create variants if required, always stick and maintain a design system based on shadcn components, tailwind css variables.
- Never hardcode content (text, copy, images) in code. All content must live in Payload CMS Globals. Create globals for new sections and fetch via `payload.findGlobal()`. See `CMS_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for details.
