      question: 'Who do you work with?',
      answer: "Businesses where expertise is the product—B2B services, SaaS, legal, healthcare, finance, technical products. If your offering requires explanation, education, or trust-building, we're a fit. Our clients typically have product-market fit and are ready to invest in long-term content strategy.",
    },
    {
      question: 'How does the content process work?',
      answer: 'We start with a 2-week onboarding: deep-dive calls, product documentation review, and audience research. Then we build a 90-day content calendar. Each piece goes through our research → outline → draft → edit → approve workflow. You see everything before it publishes.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What does LinkedIn management include?',
      answer: "Strategy, ghostwriting (3-5 posts/week), daily engagement (comments, DMs, connection requests), and monthly analytics. We capture your voice through intake calls and refine over time. Most founders see 3-5x follower growth and consistent inbound within 90 days.",
    },
    {
      question: 'What automations do you build?',
      answer: 'Lead enrichment from form submissions, content repurposing (blog → LinkedIn → Twitter → newsletter), CRM workflow automation, AI-powered support ticket triage, and document processing. We use Make, Zapier, n8n, and direct API integrations.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How much does it cost?',
      answer: "Retainer partnerships start at ₹1.5L/month with 3-month minimum commitment. Project-based work (like a one-time automation build) is scoped individually. We're not the cheapest option—we're for companies that want senior-level execution, not junior writers learning on your dime.",
    },
    {
      question: 'How long until we see results?',
      answer: 'AI automations: immediate (we measure hours saved from week one). LinkedIn: engagement lift in 2-4 weeks, consistent inbound leads by month 3. Technical content: SEO traction in 3-4 months, but credibility benefits start immediately when you share with prospects.',
    },
